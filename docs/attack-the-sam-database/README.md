5. Getting started

    1. Introduction

        The Security Account Manager (SAM) is a database file that stores users' passwords.

        [More information about Security Account Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Account_Manager)

        There are 2 possible strategies:

            * The online attack
            The user didn't log off. So Microsoft Windows is still running.

            * The offline attack
            The hard disk of the user is in your possion.
             

    2. The online attack
