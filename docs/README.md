# LABS

![Success](./assets/VOIP.png)

This home page contains an overview of my lab exercises.

Feel free to style it as you wish.

Some tips on how to start:

* Refactor the `README.md` in the root of this project. It is the first page users encounter when visiting your GitHub repository.
* Fill in this `README.md` with an introduction to your course.
* Start a development server using `npm run docs:dev`
* Generate pages using `yo innovet-vuepress-course:page`
* Setup your [Netlify site](https://www.netlify.com/)
* Commit and push your changes to GitHub on a regular base
* Navigate to your Netlify domain url and check if the site deployed successfully.
