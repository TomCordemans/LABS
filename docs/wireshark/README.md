##  Introduction
    
1. What is Wireshark

Wireshark is an application known as a "packet sniffer" and "protocol analyzer," designed to capture and analyze data on a network. It is a the successor of the once widely used Ethereal. The functionality of Wireshark is somewhat similar to the [tcpdump](https://www.tcpdump.org/) tool, but it provides a GUI and additional functionality for sorting, filtering and visualising data.
